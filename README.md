Dotfiles
========

This is my personal dotfile repo. They are organized to be easily
used with GNU Stow.

Usage
-----

If you want to use some (or all) of my configuration settings, simply
clone the repository, `cd` in to it, and then run `stow <package>` 
where <package> is any of the folders you see in the root of this
repository. 

For instance, running `stow vim` will symlink all my the files in the
vim folder in to your home directory.
